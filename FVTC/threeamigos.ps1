Write-Host " was just seven years old, yet she possessed an extraordinary"
Write-Host " sense of awareness that even the wisest sage would"
Write-Host " admire and respect. William, the middle child, was both brave"
Write-Host " and wise many times beyond his years. They lived together at"
Write-Host " the top of a hill, just outside the outskirts of town, where"
Write-Host " they faithfully watched over the townsfolk. Always together"
Write-Host " and always looking out for each other and the people in the"
Write-Host " town, they were known by everyone as The Three Amigos."

Write-Host " The Three Amigos climbed to the top of their watch tower and"
Write-Host " began scanning the town streets for the source of the noise"
Write-Host " and panic. Alexander was the first to find the problem,"
Write-Host " spotting a gigantic $animal moving quickly towards the"
Write-Host " mayor's office. Just ahead of the $animal stood the town’s"
Write-Host " men, attempting to make a desperate stand."
Write-Host " `"Hurry, we must go!`" shouted Molly. `"The town needs The"

Write-Host " had retreated once their last stand had failed. The $animal"
Write-Host " was standing in front of the $store, preparing to"
Write-Host " break in and kill the good citizens of the town."
Write-Host " `"What do we do?`" said Alexander. William looked around and"
Write-Host " saw a pile of $dessert stacked up against the town"
Write-Host " barbershop’s storefront. “Follow me," yelled William,"
Write-Host " heading straight for the pile of $dessert. Alexander"
Write-Host " and Molly instantly knew what to do, each grabbing a $dessert"
